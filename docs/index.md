## MAAS documentation

**What is MAAS?** MAAS (Metal as a Service) is Canonical’s private cloud infrastructure management system. It enables physical servers to behave like cloud instances: deploy, manage, and scale your infrastructure through automated, repeatable processes.

**How does MAAS work?** MAAS discovers your hardware and allows you to configure and deploy operating systems with API-driven workflows. It integrates tightly with DNS, DHCP, and image management, and supports complex networking and storage scenarios.

**Who is MAAS for?**  MAAS is built for DevOps teams, system administrators and data center architects — anyone provisioning bare-metal at scale.

**Where does MAAS fit?**  Use MAAS to:

* Replace manual provisioning with repeatable, scriptable deployments.
* Build your own cloud foundation using Juju, Kubernetes, or OpenStack.
* Automate fast provisioning in telco, enterprise, and high-performance compute settings.
* Simplify testing pipelines with fast, disposable hardware labs.
