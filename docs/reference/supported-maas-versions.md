# Supported MAAS versions

The four most recent MAAS versions are supported. When a new version of MAAS is released, the oldest version goes out of support. The release cadence for MAAS is every 6 months (tentatively), aiming to release around the same time as Ubuntu. There are currently no LTS versions of MAAS.

The table below lists dependencies for each MAAS release, including the base Ubuntu LTS version. This is most relevant for the deb packages, which can be installed only on the corresponding Ubuntu version. Snap version of MAAS can run on other Ubuntu versions, because it is built with a base image that corresponds to the Ubuntu LTS version listed in the table, e.g. MAAS 3.6 snap is based on core24 snap. MAAS aims to move to the new Ubuntu LTS six months after its release.
