# Is MAAS for me?

When you first hear about **MAAS (Metal as a Service)**, it sounds powerful: bare-metal provisioning at scale, just a few clicks or commands away. But is MAAS the right tool for your environment? This page will help you decide.

## When MAAS *is* for you

MAAS is designed for data center operators, lab engineers, and anyone managing fleets of physical machines. It’s at its best when:

* **You have real hardware** – MAAS provisions servers, not desktops or laptops. If you’re working with racks of bare-metal machines (or equivalent virtual hardware through something like LXD), MAAS shines.
* **You need repeatable installs** – If you regularly wipe and reinstall machines with new operating systems, MAAS gives you a consistent, automated path.
* **You manage at scale** – A handful of machines can be handled manually, but once you’re at dozens or hundreds, MAAS helps track, deploy, and maintain them efficiently.
* **You want flexibility in operating systems** – MAAS supports multiple Ubuntu releases and can be customized to deliver your own OS images.
* **You need network control** – MAAS doesn’t just install operating systems; it also helps manage subnets, VLANs, and DHCP/DNS services to keep your environment consistent.
* **You’re integrating with cloud-like workflows** – MAAS fits neatly into hybrid infrastructure setups, pairing well with Juju, OpenStack, Kubernetes, or other orchestration frameworks.

## When MAAS *is not* for you

Just because MAAS can be installed on a single machine doesn’t mean that’s what it’s for. If your needs are more modest, you may be better off with simpler tools. MAAS is probably **not** the right fit if:

* **You’re running desktops or laptops** – MAAS doesn’t manage end-user systems or provide ongoing software updates for them.
* **You only need one or two servers** – If your environment is small, a manual install (or a simpler PXE setup) is likely easier.
* **You’re looking for application management** – MAAS provisions operating systems, not apps. It won’t update packages, patch software, or manage your development stack.
* **You expect a “cloud in a box”** – MAAS doesn’t provide VMs or containers out of the box. It lays the foundation for higher-level orchestration but doesn’t replace a full cloud.
* **You want quick throwaway installs** – Tools like Multipass or Vagrant are often faster and lighter for development or testing on a laptop.
* **You need ongoing system configuration** – Use configuration management tools (like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef) on top of MAAS for post-deployment customization.

## A quick decision guide

* If you run **a real data center, homelab, or lab environment with bare-metal machines**, MAAS will give you speed, scale, and control.
* If you want **a way to manage physical machines like a cloud provider manages VMs**, MAAS is built for you.
* If you just need **to set up a few boxes, run development VMs, or manage desktops**, MAAS is overkill.

## Bottom line

Think of MAAS as **infrastructure plumbing**: it’s there to automate and standardize how bare-metal hardware gets provisioned and networked. If your challenges live at that layer, MAAS is exactly what you need. If your challenges are elsewhere—apps, updates, desktops, or lightweight dev machines—there are better tools.
